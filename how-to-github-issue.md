# Submitting a GitHub issue
Find an error in the tutorial sheets, think something could be explained better, or have an idea for a new problem? 

The best way to suggest edits is through GitHub issues. By submitting an issue, you will help improve the content for your fellow classmates and earn the eternal gratefulness of the module staff.

### (Step 0: Open the GitHub repository)
Head to: __https://github.com/DE1-Engineering-Mathematics/module-resources__ to see the source documents for all the tutorial sheets. This is where we create the issue. _(Note: you will need a GitHub account)_

### Step 1: Note where the error is
After finding an error, make sure to note which sheet, problem and part the error is in. Getting a screenshot is even better!

### Step 2: Searching existing issues
It's a great idea to search the [existing issues](https://github.com/DE1-Engineering-Mathematics/module-resources/issues) to see if someone else has already noticed this. Head to the repository Do this by switching to the issue tab in GitHub and searching `Sheet # Problem #` (or something similar).
