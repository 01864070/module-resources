# Coursework

## __Problem__
The year is 1930’s New York City and you are applying to help build the Empire State building. However, to be selected you need to write a report to the big boss to show your worth as an engineer, for this he set you a challenge. \
The challenge is to show the final position of a grain inside a cylindrical wooden beam. \
You are told that this beam is being fixed on a wall and during its installation, it is hammered into a small cylindrical gap in the wall and then twisted in to secure it. \
You are only told:

* The radius of the beam is (0.6 0 0.8)dm.
* The length of the beam is (1.2 0 1.6)m.
* The position of the grain is assumed to be positioned at (0.02 0.03 1)m with a 95% confidence probability.
* The force of the hammer is (120 0 -120)N.
* The twisting force applied at the edge of the beam (0 1 0)N.
* The cost of lumber is £16.49 per square meter.
* The distance from Earth to the moon is 356,000km.

## __Report__
Your aim is not only to find the final position but to detail your reasoning in your report  through graph sketching, vectors, matrices and state any assumptions made such as tolerances and probability.



$ x^2 $ - Exponents (superscripts)
$ x_1 $ - Subscripts
$ \frac{x}{y} $ - Fractions
$ \Rightarrow $ - Looks like: =>
$ \text{text} $ - Renders anything inside the {} as text, not math
$ \int_{a}^b $ - Integral notation (replace with \sum for sum notation)
$ \quad $ - 4 spaces (used frequently in the original tutorial sheet notation)
$ \space $ - Yep, literally a space (also can use "\ ")
